# Forecasting sales revenues and sales volume for an online retailer

## Business context
### Online retailer based out of UK sells unique all-occasion gifts to customers in 37+ countries, many of whom are wholesalers
### More than 90% of sales of retailer are in UK, remaining 10% are to 36+ country mainly in Europe
### Over two years retailer sold xxxx SKUs, 

## Business problem - supporting robust growth through high volatility
### Online retailer experienced robust growth over the past 12 months with sales volume and revenue nearly increasing by 100%
### However, daily sales volume and sales revenues experienced significant volatility over the past 12 months, with significant spikes and trough
### Such volatility in daily sales revenues with rapid sales growth makes financial planning and working capital management extremely challenging for the business, specifically for the CFO. Business faces risk of lack of available cash in a timely manner to fund the growth
### High volatility in daily sales volume with rapid growth in volume makes supply chain planning and inventory management extremely challenging. Business faces risk of stock out with lost sales as well as excess inventory.

## Solution desired by business - directionally accurate forecasting of revenues and volume
### Sales revenue forecast
#### Directionally accurate sales revenue forecast will allow CFO and Finance to develop robust financial plan using a mix revolving credit as well as short term and long term financing to fund the growth of the business.
#### Sales forecast with "possible ranges" of +/- errors will allow the Finance team to conduct scenario planning and incorporate flexibility into the financial plan

### Sales volume forecast
#### Directionally accurate sales volume forecast will allow COO and Supply Chain to develop robust demand and supply plan as well as an inventory management plan.
#### Volume forecast with "possible ranges" of +/- errors will allow the Supply Chain team to create sufficient levels of buffer stock and develop agility in the supply chain to manage the volatility in demand

## Data available to develop reveue and volume forecast
### Scope of data available
#### History - 1 year of sales data
#### Granulatity - Invoice level transactions at SKU X Customer grain with transaction time stamp
#### Data size - 541909 entries with 7 columns
#### Data fields available - SKU Identifier, Customer Identifier, Price, Quantity, Date time 

### Limitation of data
#### History is limited to one year
#### Data lacks any information of special promotions run by the retailer
#### There is no information on special "holidays" in the sales data

## Approach to developing revenue and forecasting model
### Scoped the effort to develop two forecasting models - one for sales revenue and the other for sales volumne (quantity)
### Data profiling
#### After loading the data, assessed each of the columns and data types, identified any missing data (nulls)
#### About 25% of the sales transactions have a missing customer identifier (customer ID) and 0.2% of transactions have missng product description.
#### Since we are developing forecast for daily sales revenue and volume these missing data were not deemed as critical gaps
### Data preparation and feature engineering
#### For each sales transaction, calculated the revenue generated by multiplying sales quantity with price
#### Grouped all sales transactions by date and calculated sales revenue and sales volume for each date
